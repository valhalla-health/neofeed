# NeoFeed — Reference

Conventions, schema rules and compliance posture. **This file changes rarely** — if
something here needs updating every week, it belongs in `STATUS.md` or `BACKLOG.md`.

Split out of `HANDOFF.md` on 2026-08-21.

## Architecture and file inventory

**Deliberately not duplicated here.** `app-walkthrough.md` § 2 holds the authoritative
architecture table and the script load order. The old `HANDOFF.md` kept a third copy and
it rotted — by 2026-08-21 it still described `fenton.jsx` as *"Fenton 2013"* (it has been
2025 data since 2026-08-10), `gas-backend.gs` as *"Daily_Log schema extended A–P"* (it
reaches AC–AE), and the calculator as Steps 1–5 (it is a six-step wizard). One copy only.

## The two hand-synced shells

`NeoFeed.html` is the file you edit locally. `index.html` is what GitHub Pages actually
serves at the public URL. They are hand-synced copies, **not** a canonical/generated pair —
any HTML/CSS/config/script-loader change must be applied to **both** or they silently
drift. See `CHANGELOG.md`'s CSS-drift entries for the recurring history.

## GA/PMA convention

**Storage:** `ga` is a number in `WW.D` shorthand:
- `26.4` = 26 weeks + 4 days
- Integer part = weeks, first decimal digit = days (literal 0–6)
- `28.1` is **28+1**, not "28.1 weeks decimal"

**Display:** Always go through `D.fmtGA(ga)` → `"W+D"` string
**Math:** `D.gaTotalDays(ga)` for day math; `D.pmaShort(ga, dol)` for PMA
**Plotting (Fenton):** `D.gaToDecimalWeeks(ga)` for true decimal x-axis
**Input parsing:** `D.parseGAInput(str)` accepts `"28+4"`, `"28.4"`, `"28"`; clamps days 0–6

The HMF threshold `patient.ga < 32` still works because all valid values stay under integer 32.

## Deploying, and rolling back

⚠️ **The old `HANDOFF.md` "Restore production checklist" was deleted in the 2026-08-21
split rather than carried over.** It was written around session 8 (2026-05-25), described
the app as sitting in sandbox mode with `NEOFEED_GAS_URL` commented out, and instructed the
reader to *"paste `gas-backend.gs` into the Apps Script editor"* — which directly
contradicts the clasp-only rule below and would have switched the live app's executing
identity. None of it was true any more. The current procedure:

1. **Diff before you push.** `~/nicu-tools/neofeed/รหัส.js` **is** `gas-backend.gs`, but
   the two drift independently. Diff and **reconcile — never overwrite**. On 2026-08-17
   the mirror was found holding three security fixes that existed in no other copy.
2. `clasp push`, then `clasp update-deployment -V <n> <deploymentId>` against the
   **existing** deployment so `NEOFEED_GAS_URL` is unchanged. A plain `clasp deploy`
   creates a new, unused deployment instead.
3. **Deploy via `clasp`, never the editor's blue Deploy button.** The manifest sets
   `"executeAs": "USER_DEPLOYING"`, so the live web app runs as whoever *cut the
   deployment*. More than one Google account has editor access; deploying from the UI
   while signed in as the wrong one breaks Sheet access. Deploy as
   `peeraporn.po@chula.ac.th`.
4. **Verify rather than assume:** `clasp pull` into a scratch dir and diff against
   `gas-backend.gs`; check `clasp list-deployments` shows the same deployment ID at the
   new version; `curl` the Pages HTML to confirm the `?v=` cache-bust shipped.
5. **Update `STATUS.md` in the same commit.** This is part of the definition of done, not
   a follow-up task.

Running a function from the Apps Script editor (e.g. the one-off `applyStaffHeaderColumns`
/ `applyLogHeaderColumns` migrations) executes as the signed-in user and may raise an OAuth
consent — that is Praew's to approve, not something to click through on her behalf.

Redeploys are live and NICU staff are on them: **always confirm before the redeploy step.**

## Thai PDPA compliance posture

This app processes infant health data — "sensitive personal data" under PDPA
Sec 26. What's in place and what's still open:

**Lawful basis:** Sec 26(6) medical necessity + professional confidentiality
(documented at the top of `gas-backend.gs`). No separate consent flow —
consistent with the exemption, but only covers *treatment* processing, not
secondary uses (e.g. research/QI exports) if those are ever added.

**Data subject rights implemented:**
- *Erasure/pseudonymization* — `pseudonymizePatient()` in `gas-backend.gs`,
  admin-only, triggered via `action: "pseudonymizePatient"`. Clears name,
  initials, dob from Patient_Registry; retains de-identified clinical history
  (bw/ga/diagnosis/weights) for the hospital's own medical-record retention
  duty. **Residual risk:** `sessionId` is generated as
  `initials+BW+twinSuffix` (see `data.js`), so it's a pseudonym, not
  anonymous — staff present at admission can still reverse-map it on a small
  census. Erasure does not (and structurally cannot, without breaking every
  Daily_Log join) scrub that pattern from an already-issued sessionId.
- *Access/rectification* — no self-service path yet; handled manually via
  admin editing the registry. Worth a real endpoint if request volume grows.

**Accountability (Sec 39):** `Audit_Log` sheet (auto-created by
`getSheetAudit()`) records registry reads and erasures with actor email +
timestamp — persists past Apps Script's 7-day execution-log window.

**Data minimization:** `handleLogout()` in `app.jsx` clears
`neofeed_calc_*`/`neofeed_acked_*` localStorage keys on logout, since those
hold per-patient clinical inputs (weight, fluids, labs) and NICU workstations
are typically shared devices.

**Open items are tracked in `BACKLOG.md` § 2**, not here.
